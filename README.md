GeoCoder
========

Java Package GeoCoder:

This package contains two classes:
  - GeoCoder: Class to download coordinates according to an address from Google
  - GeoCoderLocation: Class to store coordinates with latitude and longtitude and other necessary informations.

I am still implementing it, but if anyone wants to improve it, feel free!
